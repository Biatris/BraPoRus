This is a continuation of the BraPoRus project from: Sekerina, I., Smirnova A., Skorobogatova, A., Tyulina, N., Kachkovskaia, T., Ruseishvili, S. and Madureira, S. "Brazilian Portuguese-Russian (BraPoRus) corpus: automatic transcription and acoustic quality of elderly speech during the COVID-19 pandemic" Linguistics Vanguard, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1515/lingvan-2021-0149

Subject to the ethics committee's decision, we're currently unable to share the corpus itself. 

What we can share here, is the code for compiling the corpus, preprocessing it, and implementing various complexity metrics.
